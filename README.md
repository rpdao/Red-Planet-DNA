# Red Planet DNA — Bridging the Physical World and Web3

<img width="3172" height="1831" alt="noBgColor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0266efe4-b00a-4d21-b73f-42ce49b22d7f" />

> *[Red Planet DNA](https://redplanetdna.com) is a comprehensive next-generation decentralized platform that combines physical mining, Web3 technologies, DAO mechanics, and NFT tools to create a sustainable and scalable ecosystem. The goal of the project is to create a real and reliable value base for the Cosmos ecosystem, its users, and partner communities. The project is not focused on NFTs - NFTs are used solely as proof of ownership of a portion of computing power. An important architectural detail is that Red Planet DNA functions as a POSTHUMAN subDAO.*

## Project Architecture: Three Levels of Red Planet DNA

***I. Layer One: Physical Infrastructure***

At the core of Red Planet DNA lies real mining infrastructure, equipped with physical ASIC miners operating on various algorithms:

- Bitcoin $BTC - Sha-256;  
- Dogecoin $DOGE - Scrypt;  
- Litecoin $LTC - Scrypt.

This infrastructure forms the foundation of the ecosystem, where every NFT and DAO product is backed by actual computational power. This eliminates speculative value and ties the products directly to a physical asset.

***II. Layer Two: DAO Product on the Osmosis Network***

The [key product](https://daodao.zone/dao/osmo1snl84npn3pzr4tvphuh7nyqdqr960s9kx29ecex6975su3k0386qze59am/home) is a decentralized DAO solution built on the [DAODAO](https://x.com/DA0_DA0) platform ([Osmosis](https://x.com/osmosiszone)).

*Core functionalities:*

- Access to computational power via DAO mechanisms.  
- Rewards for computations are received in $WBTC (Osmosis Network).  
- Direct Proof-of-Work mining for Bitcoin.  
- Easy joining/leaving the DAO - no speculative NFTs involved.  
- This layer provides the essential infrastructure for Red Planet DAO - serving as a base to support both internal and partner products within the Cosmos ecosystem, establishing a strong connection between Web3 architecture and physical computation.

***III. Layer Three: Web3 - NFT Instruments***

*1. NFT collection: ["Purt the Adventurer"](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1peea6sz2qh34w5c9x8dmde89ykkaxwgt7e9kg7dnh2hvd2mtptcqswa9xq/tokens) on [Stargaze](https://x.com/StargazeZone)*

![collection_logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a68f5c4-7e69-40f3-bc90-3f7e941a46df)

Created by community request to enable altcoin mining. Represents a hybrid model:

- NFT = fractional ownership of [Bitmain "L9"](https://x.com/BITMAINtech) miner ($DOGE + $LTC).  
- Freely tradable on Stargaze.  
- A highly volatile instrument, dependent on:  
  • price of $DOGE;  
  • price of LTC;  
  • NFT market value;  
  • mining difficulty.  
- Includes an autoconversion mechanism that transforms mined assets into $BTC, adding cross-chain utility.

Although this tool operates outside Cosmos in terms of mining mechanics, it still fits within Red Planet DAO's broader value logic by serving as a cross-ecosystem bridge.

*2. NFT collection: ["Red Planet"](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1vk8fmh259xr4yz9qqh4x3xfrck80nvl9fu6d9gcaqjksx94xc6nqxzea0t/tokens) on [Stargaze](https://x.com/StargazeZone)*

![collection_logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3849e0e-5cad-4c27-91ac-499cbf71382f)

A scalable mining tool based on a combined computational model:

- Bitcoin miners form the base, with some altcoin miners added.  
  Holders receive composite computational power.  
- After reaching 70–80% of the collection minted, the system unlocks autonomous scalability:  
  - *each NFT autonomously increases its internal computational capacity via the global miner pool.*

**Primary goal:** facilitate DAO growth through increasing hash rate and decentralized infrastructure scaling.

*3. NFT collection: ["MiAmigos"](https://medium.com/@redplanetdao/miamigos-memes-mining-and-intergalactic-brotherhood-f09736e19127) on [Stargaze](https://x.com/StargazeZone)*

<img width="640" height="480" alt="1_xFlD8kTVPiOEI1KXsgLK8w" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/183a6548-9e6e-4b57-bdeb-176999c40a87" />

Created for community engagement, including:

- Giveaways, activities, meme mechanics.  
- Integration with multiple projects.  
- Backed by the Red Planet NFT base product.

A portion of the collection was [distributed freely](https://medium.com/@redplanetdao/nftnomics-miamigos-f0bf1c387d66) among various communities to foster connections and network-wide interaction.

## Project support and integration

![photo_2025-03-31_23-09-20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44560314-fdf4-4eaf-932d-9bc4f96d37b3)

[Red Planet DNA](https://linktr.ee/rpdao) actively collaborates with Web3 projects, offering physical and decentralized support.

**Goal:** co-create a platform for mutual growth and shared utility. DAO serves as an inter-project connector, offering:

- Bitcoin-based backing  
- Distribution channel for hash power  
- Long-term utility foundation

**Examples of integrations:** Projects like [Cosmo Nibble](http://twitter.com/CosmosNibble), [Galactic Odyssey](http://twitter.com/GalOdysseyNFT), [Binjas](http://twitter.com/binjas2025), [Weird Friends](http://twitter.com/weirdfriennds) and [MiAmigos](https://medium.com/@redplanetdao/amigo-guild-web3-community-synchronisation-protocol-ea231e49902a) are already integrated into the platform.

***Case Study:***

![photo_2025-06-18_05-29-48](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/588c67fc-0e7d-4091-9fa4-375f0f34bba2)

**[Weird Friends[(https://medium.com/weird-friends/%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F-weird-friends-f83583240be8)** uses Red Planet DNA's mining infrastructure to back its token with Bitcoin. This gives the $WEIRD token real value through computational backing and adds utility via $WBTC rewards for staking in WEIRD DAS.

**"MiAmigos"** is backed by Red Planet NFT, generating $BTC used to buy $WEIRD tokens, which are then distributed to "MiAmigos" NFT holders.

**Result:**

A circular reward loop between Weird Friends and MiAmigos, with additional community activities, all based on Red Planet DNA's core products. All operations occur across the [Osmosis](http://twitter.com/osmosiszone) and [Neutron](http://twitter.com/neutron_org) networks, enhancing their value and the broader Cosmos ecosystem.

## Cross-Community Synchronisation

![photo_2025-06-15_22-09-17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c39a1cb7-e4d7-409d-9478-da7c61052436)

Cross-Community Synchronisation is a core philosophy of the project. [Red Planet DNA](https://redplanetdna.com) is built on two pillars of value:

**I. People.** We strengthen the community through:

- Events  
- Giveaways  
- Initiatives  
- Contributions  
- Mutual support  
- We deeply value solidarity and collaboration.

**II. Technical Utility**

- We create products with real, measurable value, backed by mining power.  
- We ensure sustainability in all market conditions.  
- We form long-term partnerships based on reliability and utility.

## Red Planet DNA Mission

![GoPt5poXYAAq96C](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93049365-a0df-4a3b-98fe-c9190f270dc1)

> *To bring real-world liquidity into Web3 using physical assets and decentralized technology. Using tools like [Osmosis](https://x.com/osmosiszone), [Neutron](http://twitter.com/neutron_org), [DAODAO](https://x.com/DA0_DA0) and [Stargaze](https://x.com/StargazeZone), We're building a hybrid financial ecosystem where Web3 meets real mining infrastructure.*

Our mission within Cosmos is:

- unify people and communities;  
- build shared utility;  
- contribute to ecosystem expansion.

[Red Planet DNA](https://redplanetdna.com) is not a memecoin, not a liquidity gimmick, and not a vaporware token. It's a real business, with valuation rooted in physical hardware and real returns.  
• This is not tokenized hype - it's the tangible value of machines and infrastructure.  
• Minimal speculation - maximum transparency and honest economics.  
• The project founder comes from traditional financial markets and aims to bring real clarity and credibility into the crypto space.
